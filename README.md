### About the Experiment 

The objective of the experiment "Effect of Interspecific Competition on Species Border" is to investigate how the competition between two species influences the demarcation of their geographic ranges. Specifically, the experiment aims to examine how the presence of one species affects the survival, distribution, and establishment of another species within a shared habitat. By simulating interspecific competition under controlled conditions, the experiment provides insights into the ecological factors shaping species borders and the dynamics of species coexistence or exclusion in a competitive environment.
